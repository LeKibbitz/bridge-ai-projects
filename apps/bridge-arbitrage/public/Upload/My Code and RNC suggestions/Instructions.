Instructions.
Here how I see the structure of both  ode_law and rnc_articles.
All files are int this foldef:
'/Users/lekibbitz/Projets/bridge-arbitrage/public/Upload/My Code and RNC stable structure suggestion.'

I have added a field called hypertexte_link. I think when parsing the document, a good ideaa is tahat the parser identify the final name of the link and it will be easier/faster to retrieve all law and/or articles mentionned into an article to :
-if there only one ref, display the modal
-if there is more than one oresent the cards into the main oage

The parser needs obviously to be changed.

The sezrch bar will probalby suffer from these changes.
One question, in the search bar can we, for example, make multiple recherche at once like 25, carte expos√©e, renonce ?
Please let me know what you think.
