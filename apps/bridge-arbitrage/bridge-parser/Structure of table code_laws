Draft Structure of table code_laws

Order of the columns.
I let decide the appropriate data type
All fields are NULLABLE except the section_name filed
ID (PRIMARY KEY)
section_name (PRÉFACE à l'édition française du Code, PRÉFACE AUX LOIS DE 2017, INTRODUCTION AUX LOIS DE 2017, TABLE DES MATIÈRES, Définitions, Lois, INDEX Code 2017, ANNEXE I)
law_number
law_name
chapter_letter
chapter_name
alinea_number 
sub_alinea_letter   (a lowercase letter in parenthesis) <---This is new but it does exist, example Loi 20 OR Chapter F Alinea 5 Sub Alinea (b)   (sub alineas seem to always one letter between parenthesis)
sub_sub_alinea_reference ((i), (ii),(iii),...)    <---This new but it does exist, example Loi 40B2(a)(iii)
content
hypertexte_link
pdf_path   (I do not know what it will be used for)
created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()

This is simple but seems sufficient to me and allow us to get rid of some tables among (not all of them of course I am sure there some mandatory for the search bars (By keywords, laws or articles number,...): 
- rnc_article_relationships
- rnc_article_references
- article_law_relationships
- article_law_relationships
- rnc_article_metadata (not sure what it does, you'll tell me)
- WE WILL CLARIFY THAT WHEN AGREED ON THE FINAL STRUCTURE BECAUSE IT WILLL IMPLY TO BIND COMPONENTS WITH NEW FIELDS AND EWRITE THE PARSER WHICH SHOULD BE FASTER


Few words about the code and a full transcript of the RNC to RNC Hyperlink catalog (I certainly missed some but noot much).

Structure of PRÉFACE à l'édition française du Code (On two lines) 

SECTION (PRÉFACE à l'édition française du Code (On two lines) 
CONTENT

Structure of PRÉFACE AUX LOIS DE 2017

SECTION (PRÉFACE AUX LOIS DE 2017)
CONTENT

Structure of TABLES DES MATIÈRES

Special case:
SECTION: TABLE DES MATIÈRES
Then the 3 lines PRÉFACES AUX LOIS DE 2017, INTRODUCTIONS AUX LOI DE 2017, Définitions are only content data field and should be Hypertexte Links to the section_name field
Then the structure is as follow:
law_number, dash, law_title (LOI in capital letters, law title, only the first letter of first word is capital letter. EVerything BOLD)
Then, chapter letter, dot chapter title. not bold)

Structure of Définitions

The structure of INDEX CODE 2017 is a bit tricky to deal with because the hierarchy is handle with the indentation of the text. 
I have no clue on how you can deal with that.
The law_name is in bold characters and left aligned.
The content is on the right hand side (This should be hypertexte links to law references, they can be multiples seperated by a comma). 
One approach could be to mesure the position of the starts of a chapter name, section name, content It is always the same.

Special cases:
- When the content is Définitions, its a link to the section Définitions, not to a law.
Below the law name are the chapter names with always the same indentation
- When there is no content there there should be and the very next line starts where chapters starts, this is the content (the very next line), no hypertexte link needed.

The structure of ANNEXE I is as follow:

TITLE (ANNEXE I - UTILSATION DES BOÎTES À ANNONCES)
Introduction

Chapter number (1,2,3,4)
alinea number (1,2,...)

The parser must ignore the footer line with "Code International du Bridge 2017" and "-","Page number", "-" when necessary
